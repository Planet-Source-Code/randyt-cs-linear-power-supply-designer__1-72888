Linear Power Supply Designer

This program will help you design any of the five most popular linear power supplies. 
It assumes no resistive losses in the transformer windings. Basically, it gives you a quick ‘ball park’ design to work with.

This program helps you get close to a working final design. But you will need to connect your final design to an oscilloscope to determine if your supply will hold up under actual full power conditions.
